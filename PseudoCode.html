<!-- Sec 4 Problem: Trying to link wrong answer with fa icon
Summary
    In sec 4, we have a a table that has audio of a weekday then the user selects the right day of the week they heard. I'm able to have all 
    of the days of the week turn different colors with just one function thanks to (this) and the use of class names. But now I want to also
    display a check or x on the bottom of the table to keep track of how many answers they got right and wrong. I want to do this without
    having to create mulitple functions. 

Solution 1: Create a 2nd class name for the days of the week
    This doesn't work. All the days don't change color unless you reference both their classnames

Solution 2: Use multiple If statements
