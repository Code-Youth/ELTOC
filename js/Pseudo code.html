Section 4 Problem 1: Trying to link wrong answer with fa icon
Summary
    In sec 4, we have a a table that has audio of a weekday then the user selects the right day of the week they heard. I'm able to have all 
    of the days of the week turn different colors with just one function thanks to (this) and the use of class names. But now I want to also
    display a check or x on the bottom of the table to keep track of how many answers they got right and wrong. I want to do this without
    having to create mulitple functions.  

Solution 1: Create a 2nd class name for the days of the week to link them individually to the fa icons
    This doesn't work. All the days don't change color unless you reference both their classnames

Solution 2: Use multiple If statements  

Outcome: This ended up working! What I did was create an if statement for each icon. Then I matched
    each icons ID with the ID's of all the days on in one row. I had to have the background changing color if statement seperate from the icons changing because the former
    will effect every day with the "wrong4" class while for icons, I need only the days in one row to effect it. It's hard to put it in words but basically the key
    to this was finding a way to get only certain days with an ID. One issue I was having was I forget to write out the proper syntax at the end of the first 
    if statement and that caused an error where both other icons changed when I clicked in the first row. I guess they were right when they said most issues come
    from sytnax errors. 


        if (item.id === 'wrSu2' || item.id === 'wrSa2' || item.id === 'wrMo2') {
        icon2.className = 'fa fa-times-circle fa-3x red'
    }
Section 4 Problem 2: Lock in answers at bottom so they can't be changed

Solution 1: Remove the ability for other boxes to be clicked after first attempt using an if statement
    = Create an if statement that says once an icon is changed to either right or wrong, make the other
    boxes in the that row unclickable 
    - In CSS, create a class (noclick) and set 'pointer-events: none'

Outcome: This worked great. I got the other boxes in the row to become unclickable but it created another problem. The color
of the boxes no longer changes. I need to now to deal with this problem

Section 4 Problem 2.1: Have only the box that was clicked change color and the right answer

Solution 1: In the IF statement that gives class of "noclick" to lock box, also add its background color

Outcome: Now every box changes color when clicked, showing all wrong answers and the right answer

Solution 2: Use 'item' in the IF statement as it refers to the exact box that is clicked

Outcome: This worked as 'item' refers to the box that is clicked so I can easily reference it
    - Tbh, this didn't do much overall. I ended up having to create seperate if and else if statements for every single box

Exercise 3 - Problem 1: Can't get input to only effect the icon next to it

Found the Solution!: Just created four different functions, kind of a cop out but eh... it work ;) 
I guess the issue I was having was that all the else statements were basically saying if you didn't type in a certain letter then it would 
be counted as wrong and the function was running the if statements for every row. I wanted to have one function that ran seperately
for each row but I coudln't figure out how to do it. 


Exercise 4 - Problem 1: Underline changing color unepectedly wiht onkeyup functions

Summary:  Eliminate all variables that cause issues ex: holdng uppercase runs the functions but it counts that as a button click
so I should make all the letters captial. Also, pressing tab into the next field counts as a button click so I should move the user 
there automatically after filling in previous underline

<!-- This is section is where I explain how we got things working

Section 1: Getting the audio to play on click
Step 1: The audio tag
    - Create an audio tag with a src that links to the audio file
    - Give it an id so it can be referenced later for the button click
Step 2: The button
    - Created a th (table heading) an set it CSS to make it a point when hovering and change background color [design]
    - Put a font awesome icon inside of it [design]
    - Placed an onclick functoin inside the th called (daySound) to add play audio and placed it's ID as an argument to be used in the function
Step 3: Create the function in JS to play audio
    - In JS, gave the daySound function a parameter of 'sound' to reference each ID placed in as an argument
    - Referenced the argument and put it into a variable
    - Added a .play method to the variable to get it to play the audio ID it took

<!-- This section is for questions about the code

    Question 1: In section 4, I was able to reference elements in HTML in JS without doing a query selector. I just typed its ID name
    and JS knew which box I was talking about in the table. Why did this work without a query selector?
    - Adding onto this, when I tried doing this with class name instead of ID, it did not work?
