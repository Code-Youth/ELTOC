How to make weekday exercise 4 randomized?

Step 1: Randomize the audio file [Complete]
- Create an array with all the audio elements
- Pick a random audio element and append it to the html

Step 2: Randomize the table [In progress]

Step 3: Have at least one block in the row equal to the audio file

Step 4: Change color of blocks depending on if it's the right or wrong answer



Step 1 Problem: How to change the audio file randomly

Summary 
I want to create a function that will change the audio file that is being played to a random one.

Solution 1: Change the button to another one
- I was doing this wrong, I was trying to change it by setting audio2(the audio block on the table) = we_sound(the audio file for wed) but 
what this was doing was just changing what was being stored inside the variable in JS, but not anything on html

Solution 2: Find a way to change parameter in the onclick function

Attemp1:  audio2.setAttribute('onclick', "daySound(Wed)")
- This doesn't work, guess you can't set a variable inside a function parameter lol

Attemp2: audio2.setAttribute('onclick', wed) & let wed = "daySound('We')"
- Can't believe this actually worked XD 
- Now I just have to see if I can use it from a randomized array
- *Update, it actually works XD. I'm dying. It seems so stupid but it actually works XD XD XD
- **Update, it won't work with randomizing the tables :( Were back to square one

Attemp3: Use Jquery to replace the entire button
- Yup this works, thank you JQuery!
- The key here was using the .replaceWith() and creating a second set of audio and days to replace with but making them hidden (this is because replace with would take the elements on the page on move them there)

Step 2: Problem: How to randomize table cells?

Summary
I wanto to have the days of the week in the table all randomize 

Solution 1: Use the child element in Jquery to change 4 table cells in each row
** I think I'm fine with this for now. Just find the id of the table cell in that spot and replace it


Step 3: Problem: How to find the matching audio to the weekday in 2 arrays, and then put it in a variable?

Summary
This is the hardest part of this. I have to find a way to ensure that the weekday that matches the audio is always is put in the row. 

Attemp1: Create an if statment the random function that will make 

**Update
- Going to try and create a completely different approach where I pick a random itme from an array then I can match their indexes
