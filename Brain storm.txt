How to make weekday exercise 4 randomized without randomizing Array?

Step 1: Randomize the audio file (Complete)
- Create an array with all the audio elements
- Pick a random audio element and append it to the html

Step 2: Randomize the table

Step 3: Have at least one block in the row equal to the audio file (Complete)

Step 4: Change color of blocks depending on if it's the right or wrong answer


Here is where I start part 2 of the exercise. I'm going to try picking random items from an Array insteaed of randomizing. 

So far, this has solved my earlier problem of ensuring the answer would be in the table. Now I'm having a problem randomizing the week days. Earlier I could just randomize an array and append different indexes
from it to each table cell. Now that won't work because I have to make sure it doesn't match the answer. So what am I trying to do right now?

PROBLEM 1 (Solved): Get random days of the week from the Array and make sure they don't match the answer and each other
Solution: I found a way to remove the answer from the array
