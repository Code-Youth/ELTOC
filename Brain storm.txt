How to make weekday exercise 4 randomized?

Step 1: Randomize the audio file
- Create an array with all the audio elements
- Pick a random audio element and append it to the html

Step 2: Randomize the table

Step 3: Have at least one block in the row equal to the audio file

Step 4: Change color of blocks depending on if it's the right or wrong answer



Carter's Hints:
- Focus on changing the audio file, not the audio button (get the audio id, not the buttons id)


Step 1 Problem: How to change the audio file randomly

Summary 
I want to create a function that will change the audio file that is being played to a random one.

Solution 1: Change the button to another one
- I was doing this wrong, I was trying to change it by setting audio2(the audio block on the table) = we_sound(the audio file for wed) but 
what this was doing was just changing what was being stored inside the variable in JS, but not anything on html

Solution 2: Find a way to change parameter in the onclick function

Attemp1:  audio2.setAttribute('onclick', "daySound(Wed)")
- This doesn't work, guess you can't set a variable inside a function parameter lol

Attemp2: audio2.setAttribute('onclick', wed) & let wed = "daySound('We')"
- Can't believe this actually worked XD 
- Now I just have to see if I can use it from a randomized array
- *Update, it actually works XD. I'm dying. It seems so stupid but it actually works XD XD XD
